Environments
============

There are two primary environments in which I do development work:
PowerShell and WSL2. Or, in other words, Windows and Linux.

PowerShell
----------

This is just Windows, really. I use the PowerShell environment for
working on anything that needs to run Adobe scripts, so that's mostly
the ``adobe-scripts`` folder in ``%USERPROFILE%\Documents``.
